# Components

This Storybook is a collection of components used across all of the web-based DNDNotes platforms.

The component library is split up into two bundles: client and server. Both bundle are annotated with the 'use server/client' directive.
The client bundle contains components that are client-only, or that can be used on both. Client components can be synchronous or async, it's up to the consumer to use them correctly. The server bundle contains components that are server-only.
