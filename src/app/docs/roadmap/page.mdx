There currently isn't a timeline of when these features will be released, but here is a rough outline of everything I have planned.

If you have any suggestions, ideas, or gripes, please feel free to open an issue, PR, or send a message [in my discord server](https://discord.gg/aa7fTJEpap).

- [x] **Login**
- [ ] **Home page**
    - [ ] **Friends list**
    - [ ] **Parties list** - All of the parties you are apart of, useful if the same people are playing in multiple campaigns
    - [ ] **Campaigns list**
    - [ ] **Documents list** - All of the documents you have created/have access to either part of a campaign or just a document you have created
    - [ ] **Characters list** - All of the characters you have created/have encountered that's either part of a campaign or just a character you have created
- [ ] **Campaign page**
    - [ ] **Party management**
        - [ ] **Character tracking** - Keep track of all of the characters in your party. Their stats, health, inventory, etc
    - [ ] **Map management** - Keep track of the map of the world, and where your party is currently located
    - [ ] **Whiteboard feature** (far future) \- A whiteboard that you can draw on, useful for drawing out maps, or just drawing in general. Optional replacement for the above.

I haven't finished deciding what will be in this list, so it will constantly expand. Don't forget to give any feedback [in my discord server](https://discord.gg/aa7fTJEpap)!
