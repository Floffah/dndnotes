Along the way, they pick up Glenn Close and his son, Nick, Henry Oak and twins Lark and Sparrow Oak, and Ron Stampler and his stepson, Terry Jr. While on the drive, the families find themselves driving on increasingly rocky roads that are not recognized on Darryl's GPS. Suddenly, on the crest of a hill, a purple portal opens, sucking the Honda Odyssey, dads, and sons inside. While entering the portal, each dad is struck with the feeling that they are certain they have been a bad father to their sons."
